      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p>
        Fork this codepen to your own account (or an anonymous account) and create an entire deck of cards based on the image below using CSS and JavaScript. The end result should be a function that generates 52 individual cards on the screen: 13 hearts, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, 13 clubs. You should generate the cards with JavaScript and add styles using CSS. You may use the Unicode characters: &spades;, &hearts;, &diams;, and &clubs;. The "face cards" (jack, queen, king, ace) do not need any special illustration on the body of the card but should be noted with the letter (as in the example).
      </p>
      <p>When complete, you should save the pen and email back a link to the URL where we can view your work. Code quality and self-documentation will be considered in our evaluation.</p>
      <p>
        The project includes jQuery, but feel free to write in vanilla JS if you prefer.
        It also includes bootstrap and scss preprocessor; feel free to use either, both, or neither!
      </p>
